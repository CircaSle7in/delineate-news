# Delineate: Competitive Landscape Summary

## The Opportunity

The multi-perspective news space is crowded, but everyone's doing the same thing: showing "both sides" without explaining *why* people think differently.

**What exists:** Aggregation + bias labels
**What's missing:** Understanding + empathy

---

## Key Competitors

### Ground News
- Aggregates 60K articles daily from 50,000+ sources
- Shows bias ratings from 3rd parties (AllSides, Ad Fontes, MediaBiasFactCheck)
- "Blindspot" feature shows underreported stories
- **Gap:** Doesn't explain WHY perspectives differ

### AllSides
- Mechanical 33/33/33 left-center-right curation
- Pioneered media bias ratings (14+ years)
- **Gap:** Labels bias but doesn't explain it. Treats all "right" or "left" positions as equivalent.

### The Flip Side
- Daily newsletter: "here's what the left says, here's what the right says"
- 200K+ subscribers
- **Gap:** No depth. Single issue per day. Can't dig deeper.

### Ad Fontes Media
- Media Bias Chart (reliability vs. political bias)
- Used in schools for media literacy
- **Gap:** Implies "center = correct" which is misleading. Static positioning doesn't help understanding.

## What Nobody Does Well

1. **Explain the reasoning** — Not "here's what they say" but "here's WHY they think that"

2. **Steelman perspectives** — Present the strongest version of each argument, not the caricature

3. **Map values, not just politics** — Go beyond left/right to underlying values: liberty vs. security, individual vs. collective, tradition vs. progress

4. **Build empathy** — Help people see the other side as human, not evil or stupid

---

## The Critical Problem

> **72% of Republicans view Democrats as immoral.** Similar numbers in reverse.

Simply showing "both sides" doesn't fix this. It can actually make polarization *worse* — if you see opposing views without understanding the reasoning, you just think the other side is irrational or malicious.

The solution isn't more information. It's understanding.

## Delineate's Position

**What we do differently:**
- Explain WHY, not just WHAT
- Steelman every perspective (strongest version of the argument)
- Focus on values and reasoning, not just political positions
- Build understanding that leads to empathy

**What we don't do:**
- Bias ratings (borrowed methodology doesn't help understanding)
- Mechanical balance (forces false equivalence)
- Breaking news (we need time to do this well)
- Monetization (this is a free public service)

---

## Strategic Approach

### Start narrow
Focus on 5-10 issues where genuine disagreement exists among reasonable people:
- Healthcare policy (equity vs. efficiency)
- Immigration (community, security, opportunity)
- Climate action (economic vs. environmental risk)
- Criminal justice (fairness, safety, reform)
- Education (parent rights, collective goods)

Avoid personality-driven controversies initially. Build credibility on structural disagreements.

### Build original methodology
Don't borrow from AllSides or Ad Fontes. Create a framework that asks:
> "Why would a reasonable, caring person believe this?"

### Measure understanding, not engagement
**Success =** "Did someone understand why a reasonable person might hold this view?"
**Not =** pageviews, time on site, viral spread

## The Six Gaps to Fill

1. **Explanation of Reasoning** — Nobody systematically articulates WHY
2. **Worldview Mapping** — Beyond left/center/right political axis
3. **Good-Faith Steelmanning** — Strongest version of each argument
4. **Nuance Within Perspectives** — Not all conservatives agree; not all progressives agree
5. **Historical Context** — How did we get here? What shaped these views?
6. **Scalable Methodology** — For analyzing perspectives, not just labeling them

---

## What Could Make This Work

1. **Editorial integrity** — If proponents don't recognize our explanation as fair, we've failed
2. **Consistency** — Same standard of steelmanning across all perspectives
3. **Humility** — Admitting when we get it wrong
4. **Patience** — This builds slowly. Trust takes time.
5. **Transparency** — Show the methodology. Explain the reasoning behind the reasoning.

## What Could Kill It

1. **Appearing biased** — If users perceive unfair treatment, credibility is gone immediately
2. **Topic selection** — Some issues don't have reasonable people on both sides; knowing when that's true is hard
3. **Burnout** — Personal projects need sustainable pace
4. **Overreach** — Trying to cover everything instead of doing a few things well

---

## The Core Insight

People don't believe the other side is reasonable because they don't understand the reasoning.

Delineate's mission is to show that intelligent, well-intentioned people can reach different conclusions when they:
- Hold different core values
- Weight trade-offs differently
- Rely on different evidence or sources
- Have different lived experiences

This reframe — from "they're crazy/evil" to "they're optimizing for different things" — is the key to reducing contempt.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Validate the approach** — Test steelmanning methodology on 3-5 issues with expert reviewers
2. **Build the first deep dives** — 5 anchor issues with full Verified/Speculated/Disputed analysis
3. **Get feedback** — Does this help people understand? Are perspectives represented fairly?
4. **Iterate** — Fix what doesn't work. Double down on what does.
