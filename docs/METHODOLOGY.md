# Delineate Methodology

How we analyze issues and present perspectives.

---

## The Core Question

For every issue we cover, we ask:

**"Why would a reasonable, caring person believe this?"**

Not "what do they believe" — that's easy to find. The hard part is understanding the reasoning, values, and evidence that make that belief make sense to them.

---

## The Three Categories

### 1. Verified

**What it is:** Facts that are established, documented, and accepted across perspectives.

**How we identify it:**
- Multiple independent sources confirm it
- Primary documents or data support it
- People across the political spectrum accept it as true (even if they interpret it differently)

**What it's not:**
- Consensus opinion (opinions aren't facts)
- Predictions (even confident ones)
- Interpretations of what facts mean

**Example:**
- ✓ Verified: "The minimum wage was last raised federally in 2009"
- ✗ Not verified: "The minimum wage is too low" (that's interpretation)

---

### 2. Speculated

**What it is:** Claims, predictions, or interpretations that go beyond established facts.

**How we identify it:**
- Requires assumptions about the future
- Extrapolates from limited data
- Attributes motives or intentions
- Makes causal claims that aren't definitively proven

**How we present it:**
- Name the source making the speculation
- Identify what assumptions it relies on
- Note competing speculations on the same point

**Example:**
- "Raising the minimum wage will cause job losses" — speculated (economists disagree)
- "The policy was designed to help workers" — speculated (attributes intent)

---

### 3. Disputed

**What it is:** Genuine disagreements where reasonable people reach different conclusions based on different values, priorities, or interpretations of evidence.

**How we identify it:**
- Smart, informed people on both sides
- Not a matter of "one side has the facts"
- Rooted in different values or priorities (not just different information)

**How we present it:**
- Steelman each position (strongest version)
- Identify the underlying values driving the disagreement
- Explain why someone holding each view would find it compelling
- Avoid false equivalence — some disputes have stronger evidence on one side

**Example:**
Minimum wage dispute might involve:
- **One perspective:** Workers deserve a living wage; businesses can adapt; moral obligation to reduce poverty
- **Another perspective:** Markets should set wages; mandates hurt small businesses and reduce entry-level jobs; unintended consequences matter

Both positions are held by people who care about workers. The disagreement is about *how* to help them.

## The Steelmanning Standard

For every perspective we present, we ask:

> "Would someone who actually holds this view say: 'Yes, that's a fair representation of why I believe this'?"

If not, we rewrite it.

### What steelmanning means:
- Present the most thoughtful, defensible version of the argument
- Use the evidence and reasoning that proponents actually use
- Acknowledge the strongest points, not just the weakest
- Avoid framing that makes one side look foolish

### What steelmanning doesn't mean:
- Pretending all positions are equally valid
- Hiding when evidence strongly favors one side
- Treating bad-faith arguments as good-faith
- Creating false equivalence

---

## Identifying Perspectives

We don't use "left/center/right" as our primary lens. Those labels flatten too much complexity.

Instead, we identify perspectives based on:

### Values
- Individual liberty vs. collective responsibility
- Tradition vs. progress
- Equality of opportunity vs. equality of outcome
- Local control vs. centralized solutions
- Risk tolerance vs. precaution

### Trust
- Trust in institutions (government, media, science, markets)
- Trust in expertise vs. lived experience
- Trust in systems vs. individuals

### Priorities
- Economic growth vs. environmental protection
- Security vs. privacy
- Efficiency vs. equity
- Short-term vs. long-term

**The goal:** Help readers understand that people who disagree with them aren't necessarily wrong about facts — they might be prioritizing different values.

---

## What We Cover

### We focus on:
- Issues where genuine disagreement exists among reasonable people
- Topics where understanding the other side would reduce contempt
- Questions where values, not just facts, drive the divide

### We avoid (initially):
- Breaking news (we need time to do this well)
- Personality-driven controversies (harder to steelman)
- Issues where one side is arguing in obvious bad faith
- Fringe positions that don't represent real constituencies

### The "bad faith" exception:
Some positions aren't held in good faith. Conspiracy theories, deliberate misinformation, positions designed to harm rather than help — we don't steelman these. We may explain why people fall for them, but we don't present them as legitimate perspectives deserving equal treatment.

---

## Process

### For each issue:

1. **Research** — Gather sources across the spectrum. Read what proponents actually say, not what opponents say about them.

2. **Identify the verified foundation** — What do we actually know? What's the common ground before disagreement begins?

3. **Map the speculation** — What claims are being made? Who's making them? What do they assume?

4. **Understand the dispute** — What's the real disagreement? Is it about facts, values, or priorities?

5. **Steelman each perspective** — Write the strongest version of each position. Check: would a proponent agree this is fair?

6. **Review** — Does this help someone understand why a reasonable person would hold each view?

---

## Transparency

Everything about how we work is public:

- This methodology document
- Our reasoning for how we categorized specific claims
- Corrections when we get things wrong
- The limitations of our approach

We're not claiming to be objective. We have a point of view: that understanding is better than ignorance. But within that frame, we try to be fair to every perspective we cover.

---

## Limitations

### We will get things wrong
Steelmanning is hard. We'll sometimes present a perspective in a way that proponents find unfair. When that happens, we want to know — and we'll fix it.

### We can't cover everything
Deep analysis takes time. We'd rather do a few issues well than many issues poorly.

### This is one person's project
There's no team of editors, no advisory board (yet), no institutional backing. The methodology is sound, but the execution depends on human judgment — mine.

### Some issues don't have two reasonable sides
When evidence overwhelmingly supports one position, we'll say so. Steelmanning doesn't mean false balance.

## Feedback

If you hold a perspective we've covered and feel we didn't represent it fairly, tell us. That's how this gets better.
