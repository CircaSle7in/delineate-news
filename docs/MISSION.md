# Delineate: Mission, Vision & Values

## Why Delineate Exists

Partisan media profits from division. Algorithms serve us what makes us angry. We've stopped seeing each other as human.

The person on the other side of the political divide isn't evil or stupid. They're responding to different information, different values, different fears. But we've lost the ability — and sometimes the willingness — to understand why they think what they think.

Delineate exists to restore that understanding.

This isn't about "both sides." It's about recognizing that reasonable people can look at the same facts and reach different conclusions — and that understanding *why* is the first step toward seeing each other as human again.

## Mission

**Help people understand why others think differently.**

Not what they think. *Why* they think it.

---

## Vision

A public resource where anyone can come to understand the reasoning behind different perspectives on the issues that divide us — without being told what to believe.

## Values

### 1. Understanding over agreement
You don't have to agree with someone to understand them. We're not here to change minds. We're here to open them.

### 2. Steelman, never strawman
We present the strongest, most charitable version of every perspective. If someone holding that view wouldn't recognize our explanation as fair, we've failed.

### 3. Free and open
This is a public service. No paywalls. No premium tiers. No gated content. Understanding shouldn't cost money.

### 4. Direct and clear
No jargon. No hedging. No academic posturing. If a high schooler can't understand it, we need to rewrite it.

### 5. Transparent methodology
We show our work. How we categorize perspectives, how we identify what's verified vs. disputed, how we decide what to cover — all of it is public.

### 6. Humility
We will get things wrong. When we do, we'll correct them publicly and learn from them.

## What Delineate Is Not

- **Not a news source.** We don't break stories. We help you understand the ones that are already out there.
- **Not a fact-checker.** We identify what's verified, speculated, and disputed — but we're not here to declare winners.
- **Not neutral.** We have a perspective: that understanding is better than ignorance, and empathy is better than contempt. That's not neutral. It's human.
- **Not a business.** This is a civic project, funded and maintained as a public service.

## The Three Categories

Every issue we cover gets sorted into three buckets:

### Verified
What do we actually know? What facts are established, sourced, and accepted across perspectives? This is the common ground — the foundation before the disagreement begins.

### Speculated
What's being claimed but not proven? What predictions, interpretations, or assumptions are being made? Who's making them and why?

### Disputed
Where do people genuinely disagree — not on facts, but on values, priorities, or interpretation? What's the reasoning behind each position? Why do smart, caring people reach different conclusions?

## Who This Is For

Anyone who wants to understand.

- People frustrated with partisan media who want the full picture
- People trying to understand why their family members believe what they believe
- People who want to disagree better — with more clarity and less contempt
- People who've forgotten that the other side is human too

---

## How It's Sustained

This is a personal project. No investors. No advertisers. No institutional sponsors with agendas.

If it helps people, it's worth doing. If it stops helping people, it stops.

## A Note on Why This Matters

We've watched brilliant, caring people get pulled into echo chambers. People who devoted their lives to helping others, now believing things that would horrify their younger selves — not because they stopped caring, but because they lost access to the tools that help them question what they're being fed.

This isn't about politics. It's about the fabric of how we live together.

If we can't understand why our neighbors think differently, we can't be neighbors. If we can't extend grace to people we disagree with, we can't be a community. If we see "the other side" as enemies instead of fellow humans with different experiences, we've already lost something more important than any election.

Delineate is a small attempt to get some of that back.
