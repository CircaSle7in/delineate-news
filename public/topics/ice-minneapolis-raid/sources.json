Notable gap: limited paywalled content from NYT, WSJ. Multiple video sources exist but no single authoritative compilation. Investigation jurisdiction dispute is significant story-within-the-story. Operation Metro Surge began Dec 1, 2025; shooting occurred Jan 7, 2025. Over 2,000 arrests reported since operation began."
